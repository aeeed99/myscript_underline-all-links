# myscript_underline-all-links

This is a `myscript_` repo. See [Special prefixes in my workspace](https://github.com/nickpalenchar/nickpalenchar/tree/main#special-prefixes-in-my-workspace) for more info.

## Usage

Using this results in all hyperlinks on any website appearing with an underline (which is better for accessibility). To use:

1. Install [Stylebot](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/stylebot/oiaejidbmkiecgbjeifoejpgmdaleoha) on a Chorme or Chromium browser.
1. Create a stylesheet in Stylebot, with the url set to `**`
1. Paste in the contents from `underline.css`

## Credit

I found this stylesheet from HN user chrismorgan in [this thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38203916)
